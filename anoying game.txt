Annoying Game:

Key binds are not set by default. (It resets key binds every time you start the game.)

You need to read and confirm a TOS, then wait 5 seconds to access options. (every time) 

2 confirm buttons with 5-second wait times to save options. (doesn't save permanently)

The Game crashes randomly but saves 30 seconds before. (Just so you don't lose a bunch.)

Your mouse sencitvity is extreamly slow

Game Play: 
Mario-style Plat former:
The player walks at 0.5 speed by default.
The player can ungrade their walk speed by 0.1 but has a chance to go down to 0.2 speed.
The player has a Sprint, but you will run out of air if you run for too long. (5 steps)
It will take a while to get your breath back and will make you walk slower since you've puffed out.


You're always 3 pixels too short when jumping to get loot boxes. (Mario style)
But you can jump over it if you're not below anything.
