TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS) FOR "JUST AN ORDINARY PLATFORM GAME™"
LAST UPDATED: NEVER
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION AND TOTAL SURRENDER OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS
BY DOWNLOADING, OPENING, OR EVEN THINKING ABOUT THIS GAME, YOU ("THE USER," "PLAYER," OR "SUCKER") FULLY AGREE TO THESE RULES. IF YOU DON’T FOLLOW THEM, YOUR DEVICE TURNS INTO A BOX THAT ONLY PLAYS OLD INTERNET NOISES. THIS GAME IS MADE TO TEST HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE, AND BY GOING AHEAD, YOU ADMIT YOU’RE ALREADY DONE WITH BEING CALM.

SECTION 2: KEY BINDINGS
THE GAME DOESN’T USE NORMAL CONTROLS. ALL BUTTONS RESET TO “NOTHING” EVERY TIME YOU START IT, INCLUDING AFTER CRASHES, UPDATES, OR WHEN YOU FEEL GOOD. TO FIX CONTROLS, YOU MUST:
A) READ THIS WHOLE TOS WITHOUT STOPPING, EVEN THE HIDDEN PARTS IN INVISIBLE INK (CHECK SECTION 12).
B) WAIT 5 SECONDS WHILE THE GAME “ASKS A MAGIC VOICE” IF YOU CAN CHANGE THINGS.
C) DO STEPS A AND B AGAIN IF YOU HIT “BACK” BY MISTAKE.
MESS THIS UP, AND YOUR CHARACTER MOVES SLOWER THAN A LAZY TURTLE TALKING AT A SLEEPY MEETING.

SECTION 3: THE OPTIONS MENU
GETTING TO THE OPTIONS MENU NEEDS A GIFT TO THE ANGRY GAME GODS, LIKE:
A) READING THIS TOS AGAIN FROM START TO FINISH.
B) A FORCED 5-SECOND WAIT WHILE THE GAME SHOWS PICTURES OF “HAPPY PLAYERS.”
C) ACCEPTING THAT EVERY CLICK (START, CLOSE, SETTINGS) BRINGS UP THIS TOS AGAIN WITH A DELAY, EVEN TO QUIT.
CHANGING THINGS (LIKE SOUND) HAS A 20% CHANCE TO GO UP OR DOWN BY 10—SET IT TO 50%, AND IT MIGHT HIT 60% OR 40%, DEPENDING ON THE GAME’S MOOD. SAVING NEEDS TWO “YES” BUTTONS, EACH WITH A 5-SECOND WAIT AND A 10% CHANCE TO CRASH. ALL SETTINGS RESET WHEN YOU RESTART, AND YOUR PICKS GET LOST IN A WEIRD SPACE BETWEEN WORLDS.

SECTION 4: MOUSE CONTROL
THE MOUSE SPEED IS STUCK ON “SUPER SLOW” FOREVER. YOU AGREE THIS IS ON PURPOSE TO “MAKE IT FEEL REAL” AND NOT BECAUSE WE DIDN’T FIX IT. COMPLAIN, AND IT SLOWS MORE, UNTIL IT’S STUCK EVERYWHERE BUT YOU CAN’T CLICK IT.

SECTION 5: THE EXIT BUTTON
THE EXIT BUTTON MOVES WHEN YOU TRY TO CLICK IT. THIS TRICK, CALLED “PANIC TIME,” HAS A 50% CHANCE TO DODGE YOU. YOU AGREE QUITTING TAKES 3 TO 17 TRIES, BASED ON THE STARS AND HOW MUCH THE GAME DISLIKES YOU. AFTER 5 MISSES, IT MOCKS YOU WITH MESSAGES LIKE “QUITTING IS FOR LOSERS” OR “DID YOU KNOW MOST QUITTERS DIE SOMEDAY?”

SECTION 6: GAME CRASHES
THE GAME BREAKS RANDOMLY WITH A 5% CHANCE EVERY MINUTE. BY PLAYING, YOU AGREE TO:
A) YOUR PROGRESS “SAVES” 30 SECONDS BEFORE A CRASH, SO YOU LOSE ANYTHING COOL.
B) CRASHES START A FAKE “UPDATING” SCREEN FOR 15-20 SECONDS, SHOWING DUMB STUFF LIKE “FIXING TIME MACHINE” OR “TUNING GHOST SIGNALS.”
C) IF YOU DON’T MOVE OR CLICK FOR 5 SECONDS, IT STOPS AND ASKS “KEEP GOING?”—IGNORE IT OR SAY NO, AND IT CLOSES, STARTING OVER NEXT TIME.
D) IT BREAKS 10% OF THE TIME WHEN YOU SAVE SETTINGS, BECAUSE THE WORLD HATES YOU.

SECTION 6.5: ALT+F4 CLAUSE
IF YOU PRESS ALT+F4 TO QUIT, ALL YOUR GAME DATA GETS WIPED, AND YOUR PC MIGHT TURN INTO A USELESS BRICK. WE’RE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR COMPUTER DIES OR YOU CRY ABOUT IT.

SECTION 7: ADS
THE GAME HAS FORCED ADS TO BREAK YOU DOWN. RULES INCLUDE:
A) WATCHING 10 ADS GIVES 1 “COIN 2” TO UNLOCK LEVELS. NO CHANGES—IT’S BASED ON OLD MONEY FROM 1472.
B) 10% CHANCE AN AD IS A 1-HOUR VIDEO ABOUT DRYWALL YOU CAN’T SKIP.
C) 5% CHANCE THE AD DOESN’T PAY, SAYING: “OOPS, YOUR FAULT, TRY AGAIN.”
D) YOUR TEARS GET CAUGHT BY WEBCAM TO KEEP OUR SERVERS RUNNING.

SECTION 8: FAKE MICROTRANSACTIONS
THE GAME HAS PRETEND BUYS THAT DON’T USE REAL MONEY BUT STILL HURT. EXAMPLES:
A) JUMP ABILITY: $1.99 – LETS YOU JUMP (IT’S OFF BY DEFAULT).
B) LEVEL ACCESS: $4.99 – UNLOCKS THE NEXT LEVEL, SAME BUT BROWNISH.
C) WALK SPEED BOOST: $0.99 – SPEEDS YOU UP 0.1% FOR 10 SECONDS.
ALL BUYS NEED:
A) READING THIS TOS AGAIN.
B) A 5-SECOND WAIT WHILE THE GAME “CHECKS WITH THE RULE KEEPERS.”
C) A 25% CHANCE IT FAILS, SAYING: “ERROR: YOU’RE NOT CREATIVE ENOUGH, TRY LATER.”

SECTION 9: COINS
THE GAME USES TWO COINS TO MESS YOU UP:
A) COIN 1: EARNED BY PLAYING, GONE IF YOU PAUSE, BLINK, OR BREATHE LOUD.
B) COIN 2: 10 ADS PER COIN, 10 COINS UNLOCK A LEVEL THAT BREAKS RIGHT AWAY.
YOU AGREE THIS IS “FAIR” AND “FUN,” SAYS A GROUP OF THREE TIRED HAMSTERS.

SECTION 10: DISCLAIMERS
THE MAKERS AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR:
A) YOU SMASHING YOUR KEYBOARD, HITTING YOUR SCREEN, OR CRYING LOUD.
B) YOU FREAKING OUT WHEN YOU SEE THE “UPDATING” SCREEN IS FAKE.
C) LLAMA TROUBLES, LIKE LLAMA HACKS, LLAMA THREATS, OR LLAMA FIGHTS.
THE GAME IS “AS IS”.

SECTION 11: GOVERNING LAW
ANY FIGHTS ABOUT THIS GAME USE THE LAWS OF THE TRASH ISLAND REPUBLIC, A FAKE PLACE IN A MALDIVES JUNK PILE. PROBLEMS GET SOLVED BY:
A) A DANCE CONTEST JUDGED BY THREE BLIND SQUIRRELS.
B) A 999-ROUND ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME WHERE OUR BOSS GETS 500 FREE WINS.
C) A REAL FIGHT IN A WALMART PARKING LOT AT 3 AM.

SECTION 12: FINAL NOTES
THIS TOS ISN’T REAL BUT FEELS HEAVY. BY PLAYING, YOU ACCEPT:
A) THE GAME LASTS LONGER THAN YOU.
B) YOUR FAVORITE STREAMER BEATS IT IN 10 MINUTES AND LAUGHS AT YOU.
C) LLAMAS ARE WATCHING. ALWAYS.

CLICK “AGREE” TO START THE PAIN.
(BUT FIRST, WAIT 5 SECONDS WHILE WE LAUGH AT YOU.)
