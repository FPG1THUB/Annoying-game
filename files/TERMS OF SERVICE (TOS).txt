TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS) FOR "JUST AN ORDINARY PLATFORM GAME™"
LAST UPDATED: NEVER (BUT WE’LL PRETEND IT WAS YESTERDAY)
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION AND TOTAL SURRENDER OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS
BY INSTALLING, LAUNCHING, OR EVEN VAGUELY CONSIDERING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS GAME, YOU ("THE USER," "PLAYER," OR "WILLING VICTIM") HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN YOUR DEVICE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO A SINGLE-PURPOSE MACHINE THAT ONLY PLAYS AN ENDLESS DIAL-UP TONE. THIS GAME IS DESIGNED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF HUMAN PATIENCE, AND BY PROCEEDING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE LEFT TO TEST.

SECTION 2: KEY BINDINGS (OR LACK THEREOF)
THE GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT DEFAULT KEY BINDS. ALL CONTROLS RESET TO AN "UNBOUND" STATE UPON EVERY LAUNCH, INCLUDING AFTER CRASHES, UPDATES, OR MOMENTS OF PERSONAL TRIUMPH. TO REBIND KEYS, YOU MUST:
A) READ THIS ENTIRE TOS DOCUMENT IN ONE SITTING, INCLUDING THE HIDDEN CLAUSES WRITTEN IN INVISIBLE INK (HINT: THEY’RE IN SECTION 12).
B) WAIT 5 SECONDS WHILE THE GAME "CONSULTS THE ORACLE" TO DETERMINE IF YOU’RE WORTHY OF CUSTOMIZATION PRIVILEGES.
C) REPEAT STEPS A AND B EVERY TIME YOU ACCIDENTALLY PRESS THE "BACK" BUTTON.
FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS WILL RESULT IN YOUR CHARACTER MOVING AT THE SPEED OF A SLOTH NARRATING A TED TALK.

SECTION 3: THE OPTIONS MENU (A KALEIDOSCOPE OF DESPAIR)
ACCESSING THE OPTIONS MENU REQUIRES A SACRIFICE TO THE ELDER GODS OF FRUSTRATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
A) RE-READING THIS TOS IN ITS ENTIRETY (YES, AGAIN).
B) A MANDATORY 5-SECOND DELAY DURING WHICH THE GAME DISPLAYS A SLIDESHOW OF STOCK PHOTOS OF "HAPPY GAMERS" (THEY’RE ACTORS).
C) ACCEPTING THAT EVERY CLICK WITHIN THE MENU (START, CLOSE, SETTINGS) TRIGGERS A NEW TOS POP-UP AND DELAY, EVEN IF YOU’RE JUST TRYING TO QUIT.
ADJUSTING SETTINGS (E.G., VOLUME) INCLUDES A 20% CHANCE TO RANDOMLY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE VALUE BY 10 UNITS. EXAMPLE: SET VOLUME TO 50%, AND IT MAY BECOME 60% OR 40%, DEPENDING ON THE GAME’S MOOD. SAVING CHANGES DEMANDS TWO "CONFIRM" BUTTONS, EACH WITH A 5-SECOND WAIT AND A 10% CHANCE TO CRASH THE GAME PER CLICK. ALL SETTINGS RESET UPON REBOOT, AND YOUR PREFERENCES ARE STORED IN A VOID LOCATED BETWEEN DIMENSIONS 12 AND 13.

SECTION 4: MOUSE CONTROL (OR HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON TO MOVE A CURSOR)
THE MOUSE SENSITIVITY IS PERMANENTLY SET TO "GLACIAL SPEED" BY DEFAULT. YOU AGREE THAT THIS IS A DELIBERATE DESIGN CHOICE TO "ENHANCE IMMERSION" AND NOT A LAZY EXCUSE TO AVOID CODING PROPER INPUT HANDLING. COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CURSOR’S SPEED WILL RESULT IN IT MOVING EVEN SLOWER, EVENTUALLY REACHING A STATE OF QUANTUM STASIS WHERE IT EXISTS IN ALL POSITIONS AT ONCE BUT CANNOT BE CLICKED.

SECTION 5: THE EXIT BUTTON (A METAPHOR FOR LIFE’S FUTILITY)
THE EXIT BUTTON IS PROGRAMMED TO DYNAMICALLY RELOCATE WHENEVER THE PLAYER ATTEMPTS TO HOVER OVER OR CLICK IT. THIS FEATURE, KNOWN AS "SPATIAL ANXIETY PROTOCOL," HAS A 50% CHANCE TO DODGE THE CURSOR ENTIRELY. YOU AGREE THAT QUITTING THE GAME WILL REQUIRE BETWEEN 3 AND 17 ATTEMPTS, DEPENDING ON THE ALIGNMENT OF THE STARS AND THE GAME’S CURRENT OPINION OF YOUR LIFE CHOICES. AFTER 5 FAILED ATTEMPTS, THE BUTTON WILL MOCK YOU BY DISPLAYING TOOLTIPS SUCH AS "QUITTING IS FOR QUITTERS" OR "DID YOU KNOW 93% OF PLAYERS WHO QUIT DIE WITHIN 80 YEARS?"

SECTION 6: GAME CRASHES (FEATURES, NOT BUGS)
THE GAME CRASHES RANDOMLY WITH A 5% CHANCE PER MINUTE OF GAMEPLAY. BY CONTINUING, YOU IRREVOCABLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:
A) ALL PROGRESS IS "SAVED" 30 SECONDS BEFORE A CRASH, ENSURING YOU LOSE ANY MEANINGFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT.
B) CRASHES TRIGGER A REBOOT SEQUENCE FEATURING A FAKE "UPDATING" SCREEN THAT LASTS BETWEEN 15 AND 20 SECONDS. THIS SCREEN DISPLAYS MEANINGLESS PROGRESS BARS AND TECHNICAL JARGON LIKE "DEFRAGMENTING FLUX CAPACITOR" OR "CALIBRATING TACHYON PULSE."
C) IF NO MOUSE OR KEYBOARD INPUT IS DETECTED FOR 5 SECONDS, THE UPDATE PAUSES AND DEMANDS A "CONTINUE?" PROMPT. FAILING TO RESPOND WITHIN 5 SECONDS OR CLICKING "NO" CLOSES THE GAME AND RESTARTS THE CYCLE UPON RELAUNCH.
D) THE GAME WILL CRASH 10% OF THE TIME WHEN CONFIRMING SETTINGS CHANGES, BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE HATES YOU SPECIFICALLY.

SECTION 7: ADS (YOUR NEW DIGITAL OVERLORDS)
THE GAME FEATURES MANDATORY AD-WATCHING MECHANICS DESIGNED TO BREAK YOUR SPIRIT. KEY PROVISIONS INCLUDE:
A) WATCHING 10 ADS REWARDS 1 "COIN 2," A CURRENCY REQUIRED TO UNLOCK LEVELS. THIS EXCHANGE RATE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND MODELED AFTER THE VENETIAN GROSCHEN OF 1472.
B) THERE IS A 10% CHANCE ANY AD WILL BE A 1-HOUR UNSKIPPABLE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE HISTORY OF DRYWALL.
C) A 5% CHANCE EXISTS THAT THE AD WILL FAIL TO REWARD YOU, DISPLAYING A MESSAGE THAT BLAMES YOU FOR THE FAILURE: "AD SERVER ERROR: PLEASE TRY AGAIN (BUT IT’S PROBABLY YOUR FAULT)."
D) YOUR TEARS OF FRUSTRATION ARE COLLECTED VIA WEBCAM AND USED TO LUBRICATE THE GAME’S SERVER FANS.

SECTION 8: FAKE MICROTRANSACTIONS (PAIN WITHOUT PURPOSE)
THE GAME INCLUDES SIMULATED IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT REQUIRE NO REAL MONEY BUT DEMAND REAL SUFFERING. EXAMPLES INCLUDE:
A) JUMP ABILITY: 

1.99(FAKE)–UNLOCKSTHEABILITYTOJUMP, AMECHANICTHATISDISABLEDBYDEFAULT.B) LEVEL ACCESS:
4.99 (FAKE) – PAY TO UNLOCK THE NEXT LEVEL, WHICH IS JUST THE SAME LEVEL BUT WITH A SEPIA FILTER.
C) WALK SPEED BOOST: $0.99 (FAKE) – INCREASES MOVEMENT SPEED BY 0.1% FOR 10 SECONDS.
ALL PURCHASES REQUIRE:
A) RE-READING THIS TOS (EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.).
B) A 5-SECOND DELAY DURING WHICH THE GAME "CONSULTS THE ETHICS COMMITTEE."
C) A 25% CHANCE THE TRANSACTION FAILS, DISPLAYING: "ERROR: INSUFFICIENT IMAGINATION. PLEASE TRY AGAIN AFTER REASSESSING YOUR LIFE."

SECTION 9: COINS (CURRENCY OF THE DAMNED)
THE GAME USES A DUAL CURRENCY SYSTEM DESIGNED TO MIMIC THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OF A FAILED STATE:
A) COIN 1 (UPGRADES): EARNED THROUGH GAMEPLAY, BUT DELETED IF YOU PAUSE, BLINK, OR BREATHE TOO LOUDLY.
B) COIN 2 (LEVELS): REQUIRES WATCHING 10 ADS PER COIN. EARNING 10 COINS UNLOCKS A LEVEL THAT IMMEDIATELY CRASHES THE GAME.
YOU AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM IS "BALANCED" AND "FUN," ACCORDING TO A FOCUS GROUP OF THREE SLEEP-DEPRIVED HAMSTERS.

SECTION 10: DISCLAIMERS (WE’RE NOT RESPONSIBLE, BUT ALSO TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE)
THE DEVELOPERS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR:
A) RAGE-INDUCED KEYBOARD DESTRUCTION, MONITOR PUNCHING, OR UNCONTROLLABLE SOBBING.
B) EXISTENTIAL CRISES TRIGGERED BY THE REALIZATION THAT THE "UPDATING" SCREEN IS A LIE.
C) LLAMA-RELATED INCIDENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LLAMA HACKING, LLAMA BLACKMAIL, OR LLAMA-BASED ATTACKS.
THE GAME IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WHICH TRANSLATES TO "AS A TOOL FOR SOCIOPATHIC ENTERTAINMENT."

SECTION 11: GOVERNING LAW (OR LACK THEREOF)
ALL DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS GAME SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF NONSENSE, A FICTIONAL NATION LOCATED IN THE MALDIVES’ DUMPSTER. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WILL BE SETTLED VIA:
A) A DANCE-OFF JUDGED BY THREE BLINDFOLDED SQUIRRELS.
B) A BEST-OF-999 ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS TOURNAMENT WHERE THE GAME’S CEO GETS A +500 HANDICAP.
C) A LITERAL TRIAL BY COMBAT CONDUCTED IN A WALMART PARKING LOT AT 3 AM.

SECTION 12: FINAL NOTES (YOU’VE MADE IT! PSYCH.)
THIS TOS IS LEGALLY MEANINGLESS BUT EMOTIONALLY BINDING. BY CONTINUING TO PLAY, YOU ACCEPT THAT:
A) THE GAME WILL OUTLIVE YOU.
B) YOUR FAVORITE STREAMER WILL FINISH IT IN 10 MINUTES WHILE LAUGHING AT YOUR FAILURES.
C) LLAMAS ARE STILL WATCHING. THEY’RE ALWAYS WATCHING.

CLICK "AGREE" TO BEGIN YOUR DESCENT INTO MADNESS.
(BUT FIRST, PLEASE WAIT 5 SECONDS WHILE WE JUDGE YOU.)
